2. Java JDK
3. Gradle
4. Git
5. Some prior knowledge of Java
6. Some prior knowledge of Spark framework
7. Postman
8. (optional) Java IDE

## Built With
1. Java & Gradle
2. Spark
3. Junit for testing
4. PostgreSQL database

## Setup Guide
##### PostgreSQL
###### Installation
+ Run `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev` in the terminal to install PostgreSQL in your device.
+ Enter y when prompted `Do you want to continue? [Y/n]` and wait for the installation to complete.
+ Create your own credentials with superuser capabilities with the same name as our login name by running `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER`
+ Next, weâ€™ll have to create a database with the same name as our login name by running `sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`
+ Finally run `psql` in the terminal to connect to the server
###### Structure
+ After running the `psql` command to connect to the server, proceed to create the database wildlife-tracker by executing the following command: `create database news_portal;`
+ Follow it up with this following command to connect to the newly created database`\c news_portal;`
+ Once connected, create the following tables by running these commands:
```
CREATE DATABASE news_portal;
\c news_portal;
CREATE TABLE departments (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR,description VARCHAR,size int);
CREATE TABLE news (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,news_type VARCHAR,department_id INT,user_id INT,title VARCHAR,description VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE staff (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR,position VARCHAR,staff_role VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE users_departments (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,user_id INT,department_id INT);
CREATE DATABASE news_portal_test WITH TEMPLATE news_portal;
```
+ The last command creates the test database that shall be used to run your tests on. insert `\q` to exit psql server.
